# SP500-script

<h2> Overview </h2>
For this project I created a script where I web scraped the S&P 500 list from the wikipedia webiste and used the yahoo finance library from Python to access the Yahoo Finance API to get the open, close, high, low, volume, date and adjusted close data from each S&P 500 company which is then stored in the stock_dfs directory in a CSV and could be accessed later for analysis.
