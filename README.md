# SP500-script

<h2> Overview </h2>
For this project I created a script where I get a list of the S&P 500 from the WIKI API and used the finance library from Python to access the Yahoo Finance API to get the open, close, high, low, volume, date and adjusted close data from each S&P 500 company which is then stored in the stock_dfs directory which is placed in the current working directory and could be accessed later for analysis.
